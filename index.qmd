# Introduction 

This e-book aims to be a resource for analysts (and data scientists starting their journey at SAMY) to be a bit more familiar with some parts of R that will help them in their data to day analyses.

Currently you can see some tips (with links) on [getting started with R](curriculum.html), as well as some simple code and explanation on some [data wrangling concepts](analyst_training_materials.html), and finally some best practices for using [EndpointR](EndpointR_dos_donts.html). 

# Previous resources

In the past, the DS team have created other resources that aim to help anyone at SAMY understand different aspects of data science, coding, analyses slightly better. However, these resources have often fallen short of utility in that they either get lost in the ether/slack messages, or vary their focus/audience too much.

These resources have included:

* [Slack Overflow](https://slack-overflow-help.netlify.app/) - A collection of commonly asked questions (and answers) from the Slack Overflow slack channel

* [The Capture Cookbook](https://jamiehshare.github.io/capture_cookbook/) - A guide for best practices relating to data visualisation

* [Data Science Handbook](https://jamiehshare.github.io/ds_share_handbook/) - A handbook outlining the methods case studies, and best practices that aim to guide our approach to data science at SAMY (the scope of this leans more towards the technical side of data science, but is still a resource that everyone is welcome to peruse).

Just looking at these you can see how even the aesthetics have been mis-match as the DS team at SAMY have evolved from a small team at SHARE, to being part of Capture, to now being a global resource at SAMY.
